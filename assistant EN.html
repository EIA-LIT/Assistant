<p class="bubble answer inlineblock">The link to bookmark is <a href="https://esdc.sabacloud.com">https://esdc.sabacloud.com</a>. Since every login attempt creates a unique session link, it is not possible to log in to the system using any other link.</p>
<p class="bubble answer inlineblock">There is no toggle between the English and French display once you log in to Saba. Click on the Français canadien link at the bottom of the Saba home page to access the system in French. Once you are logged in, you are welcome to register to any English or French course regardless of the display language you are using in Saba. If you are having trouble with your preferred language not displaying, please consult Saba language display issue (PDF, 92 KB).<a href="https://iservice.prv/eng/college/saba/docs/SabaLanguageDisplayIssue.pdf">Saba language display issue (PDF, 92 KB)</a></p>
<p class="bubble answer inlineblock">Your course registration is associated to a specific class, which is offered in either French or English. If the class is not in your preferred language, you can drop the first registration and enroll to a class in the other language, or also enroll in the other language.</br></br>Please note that there may be limited availability in virtual, in-person and blended classes. You may not find a suitable class as a replacement, but you can contact the course owners to inquire about future offerings. You can find the course owner's contact information at the bottom of the course overview page.</p>

<p class="bubble answer inlineblock">This issue usually happens when you update your manager. When you register to a course that needs approval, the request is sent to the manager on your profile at that moment; it cannot be approved by another manager or transferred to them.</br></br>If the course is not at its registration limit, you can drop the course and re-register, which will trigger a new approval request. If this is not possible, please open a ticket with the <a href="https://iservice.prv/eng/imit/nsd/index.shtml">National Service Desk</a>.</p>
<p class="bubble answer inlineblock">Saba profiles cannot be deleted. They become terminated and not accessible. They will not show up in reporting nor be available for access unless someone with appropriate access is searching for terminated profiles. Terminated profiles can be re-activated.</p>
<p class="bubble answer inlineblock">To safeguard your data, your session will time out after 20 minutes of inactivity as directed by Treasury Board Secretariat's policies.</p>
<p class="bubble answer inlineblock">You are no longer required to regularly update your password. This reflects the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/online-security-privacy/password-guidance.html#toc3-2">password guidance</a> for GC system owners.</p>

<p class="bubble answer inlineblock">Any learning that you complete inside the Saba catalogue will be captured in your learning history. The only data that was migrated from our legacy systems to Saba was the essential learning history related to an ongoing training requirement or recertification. To record a complete history of your learning, you may need to add activities to your learning history inside Saba. See the job aid <a href="https://iservice.prv/eng/college/saba/add-completed-course.shtml">Add a Completed Course</a> for instructions on adding completed learning to your profile.</p>
